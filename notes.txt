The start of a big python journey!!! Lotta things to learn and cherish.

--

1. First we make a print statement.
2. Then we store the user's typing into a variable. This is done with input.
We can have prompt inside of the input() that displays, and the user and type after
that. Don't forget to add the space after the prompt within the string.
3. If the user doesn't want to play then we quit. If their input is anything
but yes, we end it with quit().
4. Then we can ask them questions as seen in the .py file.

**Special
- We can add .lower() to something to make it all lowercase.

5. Let's add a score. We init the score variable when we start the game.
6. We add the score in the if statements.
7. We display the score, making sure to turn it into a string in the output statment.
8. You can do some alegrba to the score before you output it too!

**Special
- Don't forget the plus signs when doing the print statement.
